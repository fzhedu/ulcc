ULCC (User-Level Cache Control)
===============================

ULCC is a C library that allows application programmers to write cache-friendly,
high-performance programs by explicitly managing and optimizing CPU cache usage
on multi-cores. If your program suffers from cache conflict problem and you want
to improve its performance by protecting strong-locality data and/or constraining
weak-locality data, ULCC is the right tool for you to achieve just the purpose
without changing the operating system.


HISTORY
-------
2010-02-13: ulcc 0.1 released under GPL
2012-09-16: ulcc 0.2 released under BSD license; the interfaces have been
	greatly simplified, which makes the library more focused, easier-to-use,
	and easier-to-understand.


REQUIREMENT
-----------
ULCC runs on Linux. It does not require changing the kernel, but it does have a
minimum requirement on the version of kernel. Since ULCC relies on the pagemap
interface to retrieve the physical frame numbers of virtual memory pages in
user space, the Linux kernel version has to be no older than 2.6.25.


COMPILE, INSTALL & USAGE
------------------------
Compilation is easy. First cd to src folder, and edit arch.h file to specify the
last level cache parameters of your CPUs (check /sys/devices/system/cpu to get
the info of your CPUs). For example, suppose you have a multi-core CPU with an
8 MiB last level cache whose set associativity is 12, define ULCC_CACHE_KB to
(8 * 1024) and ULCC_CACHE_ASSOC to (12). ULCC_PAGE_BITS should normally be 12,
unless the page size on your system is not 4KiB.

Then make.

Copy src/arch.h, src/remapper.h, and src/ulcc.h to the header installation
folder as of your choice; copy src/libulcc.so to the library installation folder
as of your choice. Installation completes!

In your source file, include "ulcc.h" only. Then you can access all ULCC
functions. Before compilation and execution, don't forget to add header and
library search paths to environment variables.

Refer to test/test.c for examples of using ULCC.
